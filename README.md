# 🎬 Exploring Netflix Movie Trends 📊

Uncover the fascinating world of Netflix movie data with our engaging Python project! From humble beginnings as a DVD rental service, Netflix has evolved into a media giant with over 200 million subscribers worldwide. Now, it's your turn to dive into the entertainment industry and analyze trends in movie durations.

## 📅 Time Travel to the Past

Discover how movie durations have evolved over the years. We'll start by loading friends' data into a dictionary, capturing the average movie durations from 2011 to 2020. With the power of pandas, we'll explore this information further to understand the changing landscape of film lengths.
